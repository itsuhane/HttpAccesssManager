HttpAccessManager
=================

Demostrates how to track http conversation with QNetworkAccessManager.

In an old project I was using Fiddler for capturing http traffic.
After some research I found Qt comes with very handy facility to do this.

It can be used with QWebView to trace http conversations, which is desired for
some web debugging purposes.
